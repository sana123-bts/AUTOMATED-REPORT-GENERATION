I installed the required libraries using pip.Then Load the data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows.I Performed basic data analysis on the DataFrame by checking its shape, data types, summary statistics, unique values, and missing values.The next subtask requires creating a sample DataFrame, saving it as 'data.csv', and then loading it. This will ensure the file exists for the loading step. Performed the requested data analysis steps on the loaded_df DataFrame. Generated a PDF report using reportlab, including elements like titles, headings, and the analyzed data, following the instructions.A PDF report named 'data_analysis_report.pdf' was successfully generated using reportlab, incorporating the original loaded data and the summary statistics in formatted tables.The generated PDF report provides a good starting point; consider adding visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) of the data analysis results to the report for better insights.
